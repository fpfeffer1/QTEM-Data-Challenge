# QTEM-Data-Challenge
QTEM Data Challenge as part of the QTEM Masters program

This repository contains code used for the 2021 QTEM Data Challenge. In this challenge, a team of 3 QTEM students analyzes a dataset provided by a corporate partner with the goal to derive business insights.

Unfortunately, the data of this project is confidential such that all participating students had to sign an NDA. Therefore this repository is incomplete.
It only contains the python code to preprocess the dataset, as well as the redacted final report of the project.

All code in this repository was written by me, Fabian Pfeffer. It contains the data exploration, preprocessing, and basic visualization used for the project.
The further processing of the code was done in R and unfortunately can not be provided here.
